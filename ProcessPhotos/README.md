# Process Photos - order Google Photos downloads by date/time

## RenameReorder.py

Originally written to handle rename and touch of files to reflect date/time in photo or movie metadata gathered using bash scripts.
Now I am adding code to allow it to do the entire job
* Pro - less manual steps, more tailored approach due to knowledge of all files and filenames
* Con - cannot manually modify intermediate files to get desired results
